A basic python To-Do list. 

Learning objectives:
 - Basic SQL queries
 - Vocabulary of OOP

 - Basic: control statements, array manipulations, recursions;
 - Minimax implementation;
 
Suggested improvements:
 - Store board in a list to clean up indices (maybe this would make it less legible though);
 - Speed up minimax implementation;
 - Check scalability
 
Wisdom learned:
 - CHECK YOUR O'S ARE O'S AND NOT 0'S

 Learning objectives:
  - Basic control statements and recursion;
  - Class/OOP syntax;
